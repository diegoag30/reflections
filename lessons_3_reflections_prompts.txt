When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because git can upload a version of your code that is not done yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are labels for differente versions of the code, clone is export the content of a recipe to your local directory, and forks is a type of git clone but you can clone for a recipe of another person.
